description: "Build, review, and test NgRx SignalStore state management in Angular, using production patterns pinned to the official @ngrx/signals docs. Use for any Angular state-management task, and on any mention of signalStore, signalState, withState, withComputed, withMethods, withHooks, withProps, patchState, protectedState, withEntities, entityConfig, deepComputed, rxMethod, signalMethod, or rxjs-interop. Prefer this over recalling NgRx from memory: the Signals API changed substantially and pre-v17 habits produce wrong code."

# NgRx Signal Store

Production guidance for `@ngrx/signals`. Pinned to **21.1.1** (`sources.json`); refresh with `/ngrx-signals-sync`.

This is not classic NgRx. There are no actions, reducers, effects, or `dispatch` unless you deliberately opt into the Events plugin. If you catch yourself reaching for `createAction` or `createReducer`, you are in the wrong library.

## Mental model

A store is a **composition of features**, evaluated left to right. Each feature sees everything the features before it added, and contributes state, computed signals, props, or methods to what follows. `signalStore(...)` returns an injectable service.

State is a **deeply-signalized tree**: every object-literal member becomes a `DeepSignal` you can drill into (`store.filter.query()`), while primitives stay plain signals. State is **protected by default** — only the store's own methods may write to it, via `patchState`.

## Production defaults

- **Leave `protectedState` on.** It is the default, and it is what stops components from reaching in and mutating state. `signalStore({ protectedState: false }, …)` exists, but it trades away the one guarantee that keeps data flow one-directional. Tests do not need it — use `unprotected()` from `@ngrx/signals/testing` instead.
- **Choose the lifetime deliberately.** `signalStore({ providedIn: 'root' }, …)` gives one app-wide instance. Listing the store in a component's or route's `providers: []` ties its lifetime to that component, which is what you want for local, disposable state.
- **Inject via default parameters** — `withMethods((store, books = inject(BooksService)) => ({ … }))`. It keeps the feature a plain function and stays testable.
- **Write state updaters as standalone functions** returning `PartialStateUpdater<T>`, not as store methods. They tree-shake, they test in isolation, and they compose in a single call: `patchState(store, setAllEntities(books), setFulfilled())`.
- **Prefix private members with `_`.** `_totals`, `_load()` — inaccessible from outside the store, so the public surface stays intentional.
- **One store per entity type.** Multiple collections in one store are supported, but the docs recommend dedicated stores, and it keeps each store's methods coherent.
- **Never mutate in an updater.** `patchState` updaters must return new objects; mutating in place silently breaks change propagation.

## Decision rules

**`signalState` or `signalStore`?** `signalState` is a signalized state container and nothing more — reach for it for local component state with no behavior attached. The moment you need methods, dependency injection, lifecycle hooks, or a lifetime you control, use `signalStore`.

**`rxMethod`, `signalMethod`, or a plain method?** This is the choice that most often gets made wrong.
- **`rxMethod`** when the work can overlap or arrive out of order. Only RxJS gives you `switchMap` (cancel the in-flight request — the fix for a search-as-you-type race), `exhaustMap` (ignore clicks while a submit is in flight), and `debounceTime`. Any HTTP load driven by user input belongs here.
- **`signalMethod`** when you need to react to a signal but need no operators. It is `rxMethod` without RxJS and is markedly smaller — `rxjs` is only an *optional* peer of `@ngrx/signals`. It cannot cancel or sequence, so it is the wrong tool for racing requests.
- **A plain method** in `withMethods` for a one-shot imperative call. Not everything needs to be reactive.

**Extract a `signalStoreFeature`?** When the third store repeats the same shape. Loading/error status is the canonical case — `withRequestStatus()` with standalone `setPending()` / `setFulfilled()` / `setError()` updaters. Two stores sharing a shape is a coincidence; three is a feature.

**`withEntities` or a plain array?** Any keyed collection you update or remove by id. It gives you `entityMap`, `ids`, and a computed `entities`, and the updaters handle the bookkeeping. A short, read-only list is fine as a plain array in state.

**The Events plugin?** Only when one thing that happens must be observed by *several* stores, or you specifically want dispatch/reducer separation. If a single store owns the state and a method would do, write the method — the docs are explicit that the default approach suffices for most cases.

## Shape of a production store

```ts
export const BooksStore = signalStore(
  { providedIn: 'root' },                       // omit to scope it to a component's providers
  withState<BooksState>({ query: '', order: 'asc' }),
  withEntities<Book>(),                         // ids + entityMap + computed entities
  withRequestStatus(),                          // reusable feature: pending / fulfilled / error
  withComputed(({ entities, order }) => ({
    sortedBooks: () => {                        // plain fn — withComputed wraps it in computed()
      const dir = order() === 'asc' ? 1 : -1;
      return entities().toSorted((a, b) => dir * a.title.localeCompare(b.title));
    },
  })),
  withMethods((store, books = inject(BooksService)) => ({
    loadByQuery: rxMethod<string>(
      pipe(
        debounceTime(300),
        distinctUntilChanged(),
        tap(() => patchState(store, setPending())),
        switchMap((query) =>                    // switchMap: a newer query cancels the older one
          books.search(query).pipe(
            tapResponse({                       // keeps the rxMethod alive if the request errors
              next: (found) => patchState(store, setAllEntities(found), setFulfilled()),
              error: (e: Error) => patchState(store, setError(e.message)),
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  })),
  withHooks({
    onInit(store) {
      store.loadByQuery(store.query);           // pass the signal itself: reloads whenever it changes
    },
  }),
);
```

Passing `store.query` (the signal, not `store.query()`) into an `rxMethod` is the idiom that makes the load declarative — it re-runs on every change, with no manual subscription.

Full runnable versions of this and other shapes are in `references/recipes.md`.

## Traps

- **`withDevtools` is not part of NgRx.** It comes from the third-party `@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit`. It is a common hallucination — do not present it as official, and add the dependency if a project actually wants it.
- **Calling `rxMethod` / `signalMethod` with a signal outside an injection context, without an explicit `injector`, is deprecated and will throw in a future version.** It bites when a root-provided store's method is called from a component's `ngOnInit`. Pass `{ injector: this.injector }`.
- **State must be a record, not an array.** `withState([])` and `signalState([])` are invalid; NgRx ships ESLint rules for exactly this.
- **`withComputed` auto-wraps plain functions** in `computed()`. Both `() => …` and `computed(() => …)` work; don't double-wrap.
- **`watchState` is synchronous, `getState` inside an `effect` is coalesced.** Undo/redo and storage sync need to see every intermediate value, so they need `watchState` — an effect would only show the last value of the tick.
- **Combining two input-taking `signalStoreFeature`s that declare no generics is a compile error.** The workaround is a dummy generic: `function withZ<_>() { … }`.
- **Entity updaters are not interchangeable.** `add*` no-ops on an id collision, `set*` replaces, `upsert*` merges. Picking the wrong one produces silent data loss.

## Beyond NgRx

For Angular questions that are not about state — components, zoneless, routing, the CLI — use the `angular-cli` MCP server (`list_projects` → `get_best_practices` → `search_documentation` → `find_examples`) rather than relying on memory.

NgRx's own ESLint rules (`prefer-protected-state`, `enforce-type-call`, `signal-state-no-arrays-at-root-level`, `with-state-no-arrays-at-root-level`, `signal-store-feature-should-use-generic-type`) are the machine-checkable form of the defaults above; recommend them when a project is adopting the library seriously.
